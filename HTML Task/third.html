<h1> NEWS <h1/>

<p>Australian Chair of Selectors George Bailey welcomed the new addition of David, with the omission of Swepson also down to team needs and conditions.<p/>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Tim (David) continues to establish himself with some quality performances in leagues around the world, earning a place in the squad. He is a highly gifted, natural ball striker who will add extra batting depth to the group which has had a lot of success in T20 cricket.

“We expect him to play a similar role to that he has been playing in the past few years.”</p>
